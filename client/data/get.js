    /*
        PROCESSING DIFFERENT KINDS OF 'FINDINGS', PIVOTED AROUND A MEASURE.

        Here data are reprojected around a measureâ€”for example, ACR 50 (50% improvement
        in RA symptoms). We iterate over the rows that show 'acr_50' as the 'measure', and
        reorganize the data into a sensible chunk.

        Each measure here is used to describe an outcome, a data point from research:
        the result of a study or an estimate of effect. It may be a way of describing what was observed
        when a treatment was administered, or a placebo, what happened to a population of people
        over time, an estimate of effect derived as a result of an analysis of multiple studies.

        Importantly, each row describes a certain MEASURE (outcome) using a certain METRIC.
        Multiple rows might be used to report the *same measure* with *multiple metrics*.
        For example, the same outcome might be recorded as a frequency, as a percent change,
        and as a relative risk ratio compared to some baseline.

        For example:

          ROW 1
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '23'

          ROW 2
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'abs_difference' (absolute change or difference, a.k.a. absolute treatment benefit)
          - value: '0.15'

          ROW 3
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'rr'
          - value: '3.0'

        With three rows referring to the same measure, we need a way of knowing what "finding"
        we're looking at, so we can group all the data together, and pick and choose the metrics
        we need for our UI. So, each row also has information about the treatment, population, comparison,
        and other information necessary to know what finding we're talking about. In effect, each row
        contains almost all the information necessary to 'recreate' a minimal understanding of the
        experiment or study that produced the result. For example, the row might

          ROW 1
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '23'

          ROW 2
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'abs_difference' (absolute change or difference, a.k.a. absolute treatment benefit)
          - value: '0.15'

          ROW 3
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'rr'
          - value: '3.0'

        The 'intervention' and 'comparison' fields (columns in the spreadsheet) describe (basically)
        the treatment that was administered and what comparison was made. There are other fields that
        elaborate on the treatment and comparison, but effectively, here's what we can learn from
        the example above:

          - Methotrexate was the treatment, and results compared to treatment with a placebo.
          - The outcome (ACR 50) was achieved by (or estimated at) 15 of 100 patients.
          - The absolute treatment benefit (difference) compared to placebo was 15%.
          - The relative risk (likelihood of experiencing that outcome) was 3.0.

        It is possible from this information to *infer* the comparison (placebo) data. With an absolute
        risk (frequency) of 23 of 100 (23%), and an absolute treatment benefit of 15%:

          23%   absolute risk
         -15%   absolute treatment benefit (absolute difference)
        -----
           8%   placebo's absolute risk

        Similarly, the relative risk of 3.0 tells us that the absolute risk of the comparison (placebo)
        would be:

          23%   absolute risk
         Ã· 3    relative risk
        -----
          ~8%   placebo's absolute risk

        However, in most cases where a comparison is involved, the data for the comparison are ALSO
        recorded in a row in the spreadsheet. So, here's rows 0 through 3, all of which describe a
        single "finding".

          ROW 0
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '8'

          ROW 1
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '23'

          ROW 2
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'abs_difference' (absolute change or difference, a.k.a. absolute treatment benefit)
          - value: '0.15'

          ROW 3
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'rr'
          - value: '3.0'

        So, now there appears to be no way to distinguish between rows 0 and 1. Both say that the
        intervention was methotrexate, and the comparison was placebo, and report ACR 50, with the
        same metric. But one says the value was '8' and the other says '23'. Which was the methotrexate
        value, and which was the placebo value?

        Each row has a field called 'which', which tells us *which* of the intervention or comparison
        this particular row refers to. So:

          ROW 0
          - which: 'comparison'
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '8'

          ROW 1
          - which: 'intervention'
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'ar_100' (absolute risk out of 100, a.k.a. frequency)
          - value: '23'

          ROW 2
          - which: 'intervention'
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'abs_difference' (absolute change or difference, a.k.a. absolute treatment benefit)
          - value: '0.15'

          ROW 3
          - which: 'intervention'
          - intervention: 'methotrexate'
          - comparison: 'placebo'
          - measure: 'acr_50'
          - metric: 'rr'
          - value: '3.0'

        Now we know that row 0 refers to the comparison (placebo) and all the other rows refer to
        the intervention (methotrexate). We can use this to group all those rows togetherâ€”they all refer
        to a finding: How methotrexate compares to placebo in terms of the ACR 50 outcome.

        (Of course, 'methotrexate' and 'placebo' and 'ACR 50' alone are insufficient to describe
        the study at hand, so other fields are also used to group a finding around a measure.
        For example population, dosage, duration of study/follow-up time, and data source.)

        TYPICAL CASES

        In general, there are a few standard cases we'll encounter and need to deal with in order
        to gather and reproject data around a measure. They are:

          1. intervention only
          2. comparison + intervention
          3. population
          - ...

        1. INTERVENTION ONLY

        If *only* an intervention is specified, then no comparison information is available. In such
        cases, we should assume that the only kinds of metrics that will be reported are absolute
        numbers, rather than information about change. For example, if there's no comparison, there
        is no way to report any kind of difference or relative value. We might see this in the case
        of side effects from clinical trials, where the data source (a drug product label or monograph)
        might just say that a certain side effect occurred at a certain frequency. For example:

          ROW FROM SIDE EFFECTS SPREADSHEET
          - which: 'intervention'
          - intervention: 'celecoxib'
          - measure: 'ae'
          - measure_detail: 'Nausea'
          - metric: 'percentage'
          - value: '0.07'

        In intervention-only cases, we want to reproject the data around a key which is sufficient
        to describe the intervention:

          key = measure + intervention + dosage + source (+ measure_detail)

        All the metrics that are used to describe that specific outcome are grouped under that key.

        2. COMPARISON + INTERVENTION

        In comparison cases, it's likely we have more rows and multiple metrics describing the measure
        (outcome) of interest. In a single data source we might even have many interventions compared
        to placebo. For example, in the Cochrane review of systematic reviews of biologic DMARDs for
        RA, estimates of effect are reported for 6 drugs (interventions) compared to placebo,
        for two measures (ACR 50 and discontinuation due to an adverse event), and using many metrics,
        some absolute risk frequency, some relative differences, etc.

        Because there may be many rows that need to be "grouped" to describe the relevant findings,
        we use a key that includes the comparison:

          key = measure + comparison + intervention + dosage + source (+ measure_detail)

        TODO: describe how the "study details" are recorded/divided

        3. POPULATION

        TODO: describe this case


        OUTPUT

        Ultimately, we want to end up with reprojected data that is organized around 'finding groups',
        so to speak, which we can then use for visualizations and comparisons etc.

        TODO: Better description of this.

        For example:

        'acr_50' = {
          'placebo-methotrexate (oral, parenteral) (5 mg-25 mg / week)-52 52 week-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916606': {},
          'dmard only-etanercept (subcutaneous) (25 mg 2x / week)-6 24 month-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728649': {}
        }

        Each object in the 'acr_50' object is a unique group of findings, possibly including multiple measures.
