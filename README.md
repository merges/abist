adam baker's independent studies thesis.

## Developing

`npm start`

## Deploying

`npm run:build`
`node server.js`

## Technology

This is a Node-based JavaScript React app. It employs these major tools:

 - Node
 - Webpack
 - React
 - React-router
 - Redux
 - Google apps (spreadsheets as a data source)

The app is deployed to Heroku at [http://thesis.merges.net](http://thesis.merges.net).

## Support

Iâ€™m trying to make this a widely-usable app (and open source), so [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) has been kind enough to give me a free account to test it across all kinds of browsers and platforms. Check them out, their tools are super useful.
