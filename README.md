# abist

adam baker's independent studies thesis.

## Basics

This is a Node.js-based application, written in JavaScript with front-end in JSX/HTML, and LESS/CSS. It primarily uses the following frameworks and tools:

 - Node.js (platform/environment)
 - Browserify (JavaScript bundling)
 - Gulp (build & compile system)
 - Express.js (web server)
 - React.js (front-end application framework)
 - LESS (look and feel language & system)
 - Bootstrap (UI framework)
 - d3, c3 (visualization frameworks)

The app is deployed to Heroku at [https://abist.herokuapp.com](https://abist.herokuapp.com).

## Support

Iâ€™m trying to make this a widely-usable app (and open source), so [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) has been kind enough to give me a free account to test it across all kinds of browsers and platforms.
